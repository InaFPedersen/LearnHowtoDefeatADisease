                <p> No! Have one or both your parents gotten sick! Don’t worry we can help them a little bit! </p>
                
                <p> When your parents are sick, the most important thing is that they get enough rest, and a lot of water. So, this is our chance to play a game, where you play the grown up, while they are the sick children. You can help them; you can go to the kitchen and find them glasses and some water. And you can help them feel comfortable and tucking them into the blanket. And most of all make them feel loved like they love you. </p>
                
                <p> But most important we must be careful not to get sick ourselves. So, we can’t give to many hugs or kisses as we normally do. And every time you touched them or somewhere, they have touched, you should go and wash your hands. </p>
                
                <p> Always remember even when your parents are sick, they will always care about you and love you. </p>
                
                <p> If you are big enough you can even help them make some simple food. Food gives us energy and to get healthy faster you need lots of rest, water and food. But if you aren’t big enough to make food you just do what you can for them. That is the most important thing for you to do! </p>
