                <p> I can relate to you with wanting to go back to school. When you must go every weekday it is boring, but when you can’t go at all you miss it. I never understood that part! </p>
                
                <p> But just because you are not allowed to go to school does not mean you can’t learn new things! </p>
                
                <p> If you have your schoolbooks you can try and read and learn more from them. Ask people around you when you need help with something and try to see if you can be the best teacher for yourself. </p>
                
                <p> But if you don’t have anything school related to do, you can try to get a new hobby. With Lego, drawing or painting you can learn to expand your creativity and imagination that will come in handy later on when you going to make stories for your language subjects, or even build up imagination to make products you can sell in the future. </p>
                
                <p> You can try and write a book of your experience and create images that shows better what you are writing. And you might become a famous author in the future. </p>
                
                <p>And an alternative you can play games, and afterwards investigate what did you learn from playing the game. And write down your thoughts about it.  </p>
