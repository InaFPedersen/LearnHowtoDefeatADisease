                <p> I know it is scary to become sick, and not feeling good. But it is also a chance for your body to catch up and power up. </p>
                
                <p> As I explained to you in “how do I stay healthy” it is several steps you can do to try and prevent you from getting sick. </p>
                
                <p> You can clean your hands every time you have been outside, and do not put your hands close to your mouth or nose. And always remember to use enough soap while washing your hands. </p>
                
                
                <p> When you are outside and do not know if the people you meet are sick or not, you should always keep a good distance between you but you can still socialize just do not touch or hug them and try and have 1 meter between each person. </p>
                
                <p> And if you get sick even when you have tried anything not to get sick. Remember to tell your parents so that they can help you. Lay down in your bed or on the couch with a blanket around you. And always remember to stay hydrated and drink lots of water.  </p>
