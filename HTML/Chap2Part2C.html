                <p> You can play a game called Mime game. In this game you use your body language and hands to form actions, animals or places. The game is to guess what the other one is miming. </p>
                
                <p> If you don’t have any neighbors or siblings, you can play games, or be with your parents. You can even create your own games, that you can teach your friends when you meet them again. </p>
