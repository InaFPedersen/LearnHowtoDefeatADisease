Learn How to Defeat a Disease!

Game Jam at Uia Creating a digital game in 4/(5) days

Hello my name is Ina F. Pedersen, and I have created an learning game for children, with mini games inside the game. It is split into 6 parts that all is connected to situations where a disease is up and around.

I hope you enjoy the game!
